Change directory to the directory containing the current file and then repeatedly "cd .." until ./Makefile exists.
You run it by enterning :call FindMakefile()
I've mapped <F4> to a function that calls FindMakefile () and then does "mak %<.o"
I needed this because using tags to jump to a source file sometimes left me with the wrong current working directory for this to work.
